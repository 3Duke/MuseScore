musescore for Debian
********************

  usr/share/mscore is versioned (ie usr/share/mscore-0.7), as upstream
  said he wants to make it possible for other users, not necessarily
  ours, to install more than one version concurrently for testing. Some
  files there are version specific, so he versions /usr/share/mscore.
