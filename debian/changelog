mscore (0.9.2+dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patches modified:
    + 08-disable-multiple-jobs:
      The usage of multiple jobs is not very well supported by upstream's
      build system. Therefore, multiple jobs are disabled completely for
      now. Thanks a lot to Thiemo Seufer for debugging this on MIPS.
      Closes: #487548

mscore (0.9.2+dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patches added:
    + 08-disable-multiple-jobs:
      The current system of detecting multiple CPUs and using them for
      multiple jobs in parallel is not very robust and results in a
      FTBFS on some architectures.
